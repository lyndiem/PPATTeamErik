A collection of all files needed to make a hinged wedge assistive mounting device for wheelchair boarding. 
1. Slide one 7.5" long shaft through the 1/2" diameter holes in a 3D printed hinged wedge.
2. Place one aluminum mounting plate on the Arbor Press with the shaft hole positioned for pressing.
3. Press the shaft 1" beyond the bottom face of the aluminum shaft.
4. Remove and repeat step 3.
5. Flip the hinged wedge assembly over and press the shaft 1" below the bottom face of the second aluminum mounting plate.
6. Attach shaft collar to each end of the shaft.
7. Tighten the set screws.
8. Repeat lines 1-7 for the second hinged wedge. 

9. Align the component assembly to the board so that the aluminum mounting plates rest on the L-brackets and align with the mounting holes.
10. Place one screw through each hole.
11. Attach a locknut on the end of each screw and loosely tighten (do not fully tighten until all locknuts have been placed).
12. Apply a drop of Loctite to the threads of each screw.
13. Tighten the locknut fully and let it dry.
14. Repeat steps 11-15 for the second hinged wedge.
