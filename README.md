This is a collection of all files needed to make a hinged wedge assistive mounting device for wheelchair boarding. These are Solidworks 2018 files and require Solidworks 2018 or later to open. The part files for the components that need to be 3D Printed or machined are additionally attached directly in the Instructable https://www.instructables.com/id/PPAT-Team-Erik/. 

STEP versions of all parts and assemblies can be found at PPATTeamErik/FilesForInstructable/STEP Files For Documentation, and are linked throughout the Instructable. These STEP files are compatible with other versions of CAD and are backwards compatible with Solidworks.

Explanations of the purposes of each part, how it is made, and suggestions for modifications are included in each step of the Instructable. Directions for assembly are included at the end of the Instructable and below.
1. Using the Arbor Press, press one 7.5" long shaft through the 1/2" diameter holes in a 3D printed hinged wedge such that the wedge is centered on the shaft (extending 1.5" on both sides).
2. Slide one aluminum mounting plate onto each end of the shaft.
3. Attach shaft collar outside the aluminum mounting plates on each end of the shaft.
4. Tighten the set screws.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for the second hinged wedge.

6. Cut 2 L-brackets to 7.5" length
7. Measure and drill appropriate holes for mounting each L-bracket to the board
8. Place the bottom of the L below the board and align the holes
9. Place screws through each hole in the board
10. Attach a locknut on the end of each screw and loosely tighten (do not fully tighten until all locknuts have been placed).
11. Apply a drop of Loctite to the threads of each screw.
12. Tighten the locknut fully and let it dry.
13. Align the component assembly to the board so that the aluminum mounting plates rest on the top of the L-brackets and align with the mounting holes.
14. Drill appropriate holes for mounting the component assembly to the board with the aluminum mounting plates resting on the top of the L-brackets
15. Place one screw through each hole of the mounting plates
16. Attach a locknut on the end of each screw and loosely tighten (do not fully tighten until both locknuts have been placed).
17. Apply a drop of Loctite to the threads of each screw.
18. Tighten the locknut fully and let it dry.
19. Repeat steps 8-18 for the second hinged wedge.
